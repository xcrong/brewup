## 🚀 Installation

### From Source (Alternative)

1. Ensure you have Rust 1.70+ installed. If not, install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)

2. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xcrong/brewup.git
   cd brewup
   make install
   ```


**Recommended approaches:**
- Build from source using Cargo
- Use the provided security scripts if downloading binaries

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage

Run brewup to upgrade all packages and clean up (shows detailed output by default):

```bash
brewup
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
brewup [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -v, --verbose        Show verbose output (redundant - default is already verbose)
      --dry-run        Preview operations without executing any changes
      --skip-cleanup   Skip the cleanup step (brew cleanup --prune=all)
  -h, --help          Print help information
  -V, --version       Print version information
```



### Examples

**Standard upgrade with cleanup (default):**
```bash
brewup
```

**Preview changes without execution:**
```bash
brewup --dry-run
```

**Upgrade packages but skip cleanup:**
```bash
brewup --skip-cleanup
```

**Verbose output (redundant as default is verbose):**
```bash
brewup --verbose
```

**Combine multiple options:**
```bash
brewup --verbose --dry-run
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

BrewUp is built with a modular, maintainable architecture:

```
src/
├── main.rs          # Application entry point and CLI handling
├── lib.rs           # Library crate declarations
├── cli.rs           # Command-line interface configuration
├── commands.rs      # Core application logic and workflow
├── config.rs        # Configuration management and constants
└── utils.rs         # Utility functions and helpers
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with clear messages
- **Testability**: Modular design enables easy unit testing
- **Documentation**: Complete Rustdoc comments throughout
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration management

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Integration with Daily Workflow

Integrate brewup into your daily development workflow using the provided scripts:

- `examples/daily-update.sh` - A comprehensive daily update script
- `examples/setup-cron.sh` - Interactive cron job setup script

### Automated Updates

Set up daily automated updates:

```bash
# Make the cron setup script executable and run it
chmod +x examples/setup-cron.sh
./examples/setup-cron.sh
```

This will guide you through setting up a cron job to run brewup at your preferred time.

### Manual Cron Setup

For manual cron configuration:

```bash
# Edit your crontab
crontab -e

# Add a line like this for daily updates at 9 AM:
0 9 * * * /Users/$USER/.local/bin/brewup --verbose >> /Users/$USER/.local/log/brewup.log 2>&1
```

### Logging

For automated execution, log the output:

```bash
brewup --verbose >> ~/brewup.log 2>&1
```

## 🔄 Workflow

BrewUp executes the following operations sequentially:

1. **Updates Homebrew** - Executes `brew update` for latest package information
2. **Upgrades Packages** - Runs `brew upgrade` to update all installed packages
3. **Cleans Up** - Executes `brew cleanup --prune=all` to remove old versions and cache
4. **Shows Summary** - Displays installed packages and their versions


## 🛡️ Error Handling

- **Homebrew not found**: Exits with error code 1 and clear message
- **Update/upgrade failures**: Critical errors that stop execution
- **Cleanup failures**: Non-critical warnings that allow continuation
- **Argument errors**: Clear error messages with usage suggestions
- **Command execution**: Comprehensive error capture and reporting

## 💻 Development

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build release version
make build

# Development workflow (format, lint, test, build)
make dev

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make fmt

# Run clippy lints
make clippy
```





### Development Execution

```bash
# Run directly
make run

# Test with dry-run
make dry-run

# Test with verbose output
make verbose

# Test with both flags
make dry-verbose
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found**
- Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH
- Add to shell profile: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
- Re-run `make install` if needed

**Permission errors**
- Ensure binary is executable: `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/brewup`
- Verify installation directory permissions

**Homebrew missing**
- Install Homebrew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

**Cleanup warnings**
- Cleanup warnings are usually not critical and the tool will continue

### Logs

When running automated updates, check the logs:
```bash
tail -f ~/.local/log/brewup.log
```
